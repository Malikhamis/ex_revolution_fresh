sudo systemctl start mongod
sudo systemctl enable mongod

# 2. Create database user
mongo
> use exrevolution
> db.createUser({
    user: "exrevuser",
    pwd: "secure-password",
    roles: ["readWrite"]
  })

# 3. Run migrations (if any)
node scripts/migrate.js
```

### Step 3: Web Server Configuration

sudo cp nginx/exrevolution.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/exrevolution.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx

# 2. Configure SSL
sudo certbot --nginx -d exrevolution.com -d www.exrevolution.com
```

### Step 4: Application Deployment
```bash
# 1. Use deployment script
./scripts/deploy.sh

# 2. Or manual deployment
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production
pm2 save
pm2 startup
```

### Step 5: Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
